Introductory course to the cluster system of the JGU

## Getting help
The HPC provides help in profiling programs and also improving (paralellizing) your own tools. Contact them via the mailling-list to have a quick answer. There is also the possibility of meeting with them (Thursday workshop) and discuss your problems.

They also provide help on writting grants, specifically the HPC details - if needed. Gratis. 

When asking for help with an error, prepare a minimum example of the code and a small set of data. Also confer access to the relevant folders.
They already provide manz courses, and will provide many more courses, including C++, python, openMP.
